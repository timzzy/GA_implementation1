# GA_implementation1
The operation of a operational unit to determine if they are open or closed for a specified period of time is predicted using the GA optimization. 
The array of 0s and 1s may represents the choices of closed or open hospital units providing a given service. We then evaluate each solution against predetermined criteria. The result of prediction is plotted in a graphical representation using Matplotlib module in python.
An initial reference population that reads suggests the opening or closing of the unit is predefined, which other population to be sampled will be compared against.
